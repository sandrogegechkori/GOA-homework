<p>Situated at the strategically important crossroads where Europe meets Asia, Georgia has a unique and ancient cultural heritage, and is famed for its traditions of hospitality and cuisine. 
Over the centuries, Georgia was the object of rivalry between Persia, Turkey and Russia, before being eventually annexed by Russia in the 19th Century.</p>

<h2>TIMELINE</h2>
<p>11th Century - Georgian kingdom becomes politically unified under the Bagrationi dynasty.</p>
<p>12th-13th Centuries - Kingdom of Georgia reaches its zenith during the reigns of David IV (reigned 1089-1125) and his great-granddaughter Tamar (reigned 1184-1213).</p>
<p>1220-1330s - Mongol invasions and occupations of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>1299-1302 - George V of Georgia defeats the Mongols and restores the Georian kingdom. After his death, Georgia disintegrates politically and collapses by the 15th Century.</p>
<p>16th-18th Centuries - Safavid Iran (and successive Iranian Afsharid and Qajar dynasties) and Ottoman Turkey subjugate the eastern and western parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>1801-1804 - Most of present-day Georgia becomes part of the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>1879 - History's best-known Georgian, future Soviet leader Iosif Dzhugashvili (Joseph Stalin), is born in the town of Gori.</p>
<p>1918 - Independent Georgian state declared in wake of Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>1921 - Red Army invades, Georgia absorbed into emerging Soviet Union.</p>
<p>1956 - Protests against Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy turn violent and prompt calls for secession from the USSR; they are brutally crushed by Soviet forces.</p>
<p>1989 - Demands for more autonomy in South Ossetia lead to violent clashes between Georgians and Ossetians. Soviet - later Russian - peacekeepers are deployed.</p>
<p>1990-92 - After several outbreaks of violence, South Ossetia declares its intention to secede from Georgia and proclaims independence in 1992. Sporadic violence involving Georgian irregular forces and Ossetian fighters continues until agreement on the deployment of Georgian, Ossetian and Russian peacekeepers is reached.</p>
<p>1991 - Georgian parliament declares secession from the Soviet Union after independence is overwhelmingly supported in a referendum.</p>
<p>1992-93 - Georgia-Abkhazia War: Georgia sends troops to Abkhazia to halt moves for secession. Fierce fighting ends with Georgian forces being expelled from Abkhazia. Up to 30,000 people are killed. Before the war Georgians make up nearly half of Abkhazia's population, but up to 250,000 Georgians and others are expelled, virtually halving Abkhazia's population.</p>
<p>1994 - Georgian government and Abkhaz separatists sign a ceasefire agreement, paving the way for the deployment of a Russian peacekeeping force in the region.</p>
<p>2001- Clashes in Abkhazia between Abkhaz troops and Georgian paramilitaries backed by fighters from the North Caucasus. The tension is heightened as Russia accuses Georgia of harbouring Chechen rebels, a charge dismissed by Georgia.</p>
<p>2004 - Several deaths are reported in clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces.</p>
<p>2006 - South Ossetians vote in favour of independence in an unrecognised referendum.</p>
<p>2008 - Tensions between Georgia and Russia escalate into a full-blown military conflict after Georgia tries to retake South Ossetia by force following lower-level clashes with Russian-backed rebels.
Russian forces counter-attack and push Georgian troops out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After five days of fighting, the two sides sign a French-brokered peace agreement. Russia recognises both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states - very few other countries do.</p>
